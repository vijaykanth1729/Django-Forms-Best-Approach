there is a builtn in User model provided by django which has some attributes we can use them in
our own applications..
User models is inherited--> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User models has-->Username, password, email, first_name, last_name..


form modifications:
----------------------
install an external library that supports form modfification in a better way.
#   pip install django-crispy-forms
we need to make some changes in settings.py file..
add crispy_forms in installed apps section
and also add --> CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'


Login Functionality:
----------------------
will use Django authentication system to handle all the authentication part..

we need to import  --> from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login, logout..

to create a authentication system will create a new app called as accounts..
and will include all the routes, urls, views in that app..

Logout functionality:
------------------------
logout is imported from django.contrib.auth  import logout

will create a function and uses a logout functionality with passing the request as its parameter..
so it can able to logout the user of that session..

then we need to modify our urls.py file and views.py file to work the logout functionality..

Register Functionality:
------------------------
instead of using plain html forms will go with django builtin forms to handle the registration...
we can register a user by providing a username and a password for now, later will add other fields..


once we create a form in forms.py file we need to add  a url route to handle the forms, and will create a view function
to handle the backend logic..
